Accessibility is an important consideration for any open-source software
project.
Please see [this discussion][accessibility_discuss] for further
background information on accessibility.

This article details some best practices that can be adopted by ecosystem
projects to improve accessibility.

## Documentation

The documentation for a project is the primary way that most users interface
with a project.
As such, ensuring the documentation is accessible is of utmost importance.

### Accessible documentation themes

Projects in the scientific Python ecosystem typically use [sphinx][sphinx-doc]
to generate reference and narrative documentation for projects.
Sphinx includes the ability to set a
[consistent theme for the generated html][sphinx-themes], which control various
aspects including page layout, color scheme, and keyboard navigation support.
It is strongly recommended for projects to select a sphinx theme that is
*explicitly designed with accessibility in mind*.
For example, the [pydata-sphinx-theme][pydata-sphinx-theme] integrates
[accessibility validation][accessibility-checks] into its development workflow.
